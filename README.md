## Description

This [Scala solution](https://github.com/taylorjg/Pouring/blob/master/Pouring.scala) to the Pouring problem was presented during a video lecture in the last week of the Coursera "Functional Programming Principles in Scala" course. I am currently learning Haskell so, as an exercise, I translated the solution to Haskell.
